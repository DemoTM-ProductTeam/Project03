# 📊 Project03 — Business-Oriented Analytics for Decision Making

## 📌 Project Overview
**Project03** is a core analytical project within **TM_Portfolio**, designed to demonstrate end-to-end **business-oriented data analytics capabilities**.  
Rather than focusing solely on technical execution, the project emphasizes **decision-making logic, business impact, and strategic insight generation** from data.

This project showcases how a Data Analyst translates data into **clear recommendations that directly support management and business performance improvement**.
